How to Applying the ns-2 patch for hard limit CoDel
===================================================

Simply cd into ns-allinone-2.35, run patch -p1 < hard-limit-CoDel-ns-2.35.patch,
then build ns-2 normally. The original CoDel patch is not required.

Note: the "hard limit" mode is disabled by default, so you're using the
      original algorithm by default. To enable "hard limit", for example, 
      run "Queue/CoDel set maxdelay_ 50". The max delay is specified in
      milliseconds.

How to Apply the OpenWRT patch for hard limit CoDel
===================================================

1. Follow the steps in OpenWRT buildroot installation wiki page
   (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence), install svn, git and other packages.

2. Clone the OpenWRT 12.09 branch.

   cd ~
   mkdir openwrt
   cd openwrt
   git clone git://git.openwrt.org/12.09/openwrt.git

3. Download and install feeds.

   cd ~/openwrt/openwrt
   ./scripts/feeds update -a
   ./scripts/feeds install -a

4. Configure and compile.

   make defconfig
   make menuconfig
   
   As we're testing the algorithm with WNDR3700v2, we made the changes below in menuconfig:
   
   - Target System: AR7xxx/AR9xxx
   - Sub Target: Generic
   - Target Profile (NETGEAR WNDR3700/WNDR3800/WNDRMAC)
   - Include: LuCI / Collenction / luci
   - Include: Kernel modules / Network Support / kmod-sched
   - Include: Kernel modules / Network Support / kmod-netem
   - Include: Network / tc
   - Include: Network / iperf
   - Include: Network / iperf-mt
   
   Save configuration and enter "make". Then wait until finish.

5. Now the source code of the Linux kernel and the iproute2 package has been downloaded, 
   and the patches from OpenWRT have been applied before compiling. It's time to apply
   the "hlc" patch.

   cd into ~/openwrt/openwrt/build_dir/linux-ar71xx_generic, and execute:
   
   patch -p1 < hard-limit-CoDel-OpenWRT-12.09-linux-3.3.8.patch
   
   cd into ~/openwrt/openwrt/build_dir/target-mips_r2_uClibc-0.9.33.2, and execute
   
   patch -p1 < hard-limit-CoDel-OpenWRT-12.09-iproute2-3.3.0.patch
   
   Then build OpenWRT again. Hard limit CoDel will be added to the new firmware.

Note: When the 12.09 branch is updated, you may fail to apply the patches.
      If so, you have to apply the patches manually, though it's quite simple and
      straightforward.
