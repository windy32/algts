# algts

algts is an application suite for studying issues about link-sharing gateways.

Tests under algts are similar to so called Hardware-in-the-Loop tests, the difference is no simulator, real-time scheduler, or packet analyzer is involved, all trace items are from application layer logic.

Click on [QuickSetupGuide](https://github.com/windy32/algts/wiki/Quick-Setup-Guide) if you want the testbed configured and start working as soon as possible.

### The project consists of 4 parts: ###

 * a simulator-like core that resembles ns3 a bit
 * a qt-based gui for further analysis of trace files and more convenience (this part has now be replaced by scripting for flexibility)
 * a tutorial document
 * an api document
