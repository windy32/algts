Introduction
------------

algts is an application suite for studying issues about link-sharing gateways.

Tests under algts are similar to so called Hardware-in-the-Loop tests, the difference is no
simulator, real-time scheduler, or packet analyzer is involved, all trace items are from application
layer logic.

The `algts project <http://algts.googlecode.com>`_ started in 2012, is an open-source project
developing algts, the source code is released under the license of GNU General Public License
version 2.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce algts to new users in a structured way. It is sometimes
difficult for new users to glean essential information from detailed manuals. In this tutorial, we
will build several example test scenarios, introducing and explaining key concepts and features as
we go.

Tutorial Organization
*********************

The tutorial assumes that new users might initially follow a path such as the following:

* Try to download and build a copy;
* Try to run a few sample programs;
* Look at emulation output, and try to adjust it.

As a result, we have tried to organize the tutorial along the above broad sequences of events.
