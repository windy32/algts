Futures
*******

This document is intended as a living document. We hope and expect it to grow over time to cover
more and more of the nuts and bolts of algts.

Writing manual and tutorial chapters is not something we all get excited about, but it is very
important to the project. If you are an expert in one of these areas, please consider contributing
to algts by providing one of these chapters; or any other chapter you may think is important.

Closing
*******

Though algts is not a complicated system, it is impossible to cover all of the things you will need
to know in one small tutorial. Readers who want to learn more are encouraged to read the following additional documentation:

* The algts Doxygen (API documentation)
* The algts wiki

-- The algts development team.
